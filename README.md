About CNN-Cert
=====================================
CNN-Cert is a general and efficient framework for certifying the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
CNN-Cert is able to certify lower bounds on the minimum adversarial distortion for a variety of CNNs, 
including those with pooling layers, general activation functions and residual layers. CNN-Cert is also efficient: it exploits convolutional structure to produce bounds more efficiently than comparable certification methods.
